<h4 id="orgheadline3">Really, what is Spacemacs?</h4>
<p class="fragment">
From their <a href="https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/" class="fragment">Github</a> page:
</p>

<blockquote  class="fragment roll-in">
<p>
Spacemacs is a new way to experience Emacs &#x2013; a sophisticated and polished set-up focused on ergonomics, mnemonics and consistency.
</p>

<p>
Just clone it, launch it, then press the space bar to explore the interactive list of carefully-chosen key bindings. You can also press the home buffer's [?] button for some great first key bindings to try.
</p>

<p>
Spacemacs can be used naturally by both Emacs and Vim users &#x2013; you can even mix the two editing styles. Switching easily between input styles makes Spacemacs a great tool for pair-programming.
</p>
</blockquote>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
For those of you who think these claims are too grandiloquent, I hope
to convince you otherwise by the end of this presentation.
</p>

<p>
Mixing between both has spoiled me a bit - I'm a longtime Emacs user
who recently described the joy of modal editing, and now I want this
everywhere - Normal-mode navigation and Emacs-style shortcuts while
in Insert-mode.
</p>

<p>
The point about pair programming is a biggie. Emacs can be launched
directly from the command line, and that makes it a great candidate for
pair programming via free tools such as tmate. Also, it caters to
Greeks and Trojans - so almost everyone will know how to navigate
around with one or the other.

<section id="slide-orgheadline5">
<h3 id="orgheadline5">Why should I care?</h3>
<p class="fragment">
It comes with a lot of integrated goodies to help with development.
</p>

<p class="fragment">
"Help" is a misnomer here - most modes are on par with so-called
"professional" tools, and for less mainstream languages, it's actually
the best development environment.
</p>

<p class="fragment">
It can be used by both Vim and Emacs users - so if you think Emacs "is
a good OS, just lacking a decent editor", think again.
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
I'm basically rephrasing the quote in the previous slide, but the
point I'm trying to make is: this is Good Stuff™.
</p>

<p>
You know that joke about Emacs giving users carpal tunnel syndrome? I
used to type a lot when I was a C# programmer, and eventually it took
its toll on my hands (it was Visual Studio, so no blame on Emacs here,
even though I agree its keybindings could be more ergonomic).
I looked into modal editing and eventually into Spacemacs because of
that, and haven't looked back ever since.

<p class="fragment">
Not only that, but almost all Vim commands work as expected.
</p>

<p class="fragment">
Emacs keybindings' are setup per-mode, so to make it work seamlessly
across all modes (even very customized ones, such as Org-mode and Magit) is
harder than it looks.
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Not trying to brag about how much of a feat of programming is to make
a Vi clone, but implement its emulator in another editor? Well, that's
a bit different. Hats off to Emacs, for its almost infinite
extensibility, and to Vi, for being such a pleasure to type code in.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
If you don't know what I'm talking about when I mention 'Vim language'
(and it's not VimScript), I encourage you to look at the famous SO
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1218390/what-is-your-most-productive-shortcut-with-vim/1220118#1220118">post</a> "Your problem with Vim is that you don't grok vi".
</p>

<p>
I wouldn't be too happy about defining a new operator, though - its
internals aren't exactly very readable, IMHO. Although I think with
aid from the macrostep package, it'll be much more pleasant than
reading Vi source.

<h3 id="orgheadline11">Keyboard macros</h3>
<p>
The 'q' verb is used for saving keyboard macros.
</p>

<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Can be saved to registers</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in"><p>
Can be edited ("C-x C-k e")

</p>
</div></li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Not only can be edited, but also can be saved and re-used as ELisp
functions. Crazy, and really cool. There was some talk in an Emacs
forum about going all the way and substituting key sequences for
internal calls - I'm not sure how difficult that would be, but man,
it'd be like compiling keyboard macros into actual code. How many
tools you know that can do that? Honest question. I can think of
Excel, maybe.

<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Universal leader key (SPC)</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
No pretty pictures here because I was a bit tired when I made this slide.
</p>

<p>
The leader key being bound to Space is important - the space key is
the biggest in the keyboard, so this means that almost every finger
can touch it. Does wonders for ergonomics.

<h3 id="orgheadline13">Ergonomics</h3>
<p>
Summary:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Vim keybindings everywhere</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Every command is triggered with at most 3 keystrokes.</li>
<li class="fragment roll-in">Emacs = "Escape Meta Alt Control Shift"? Not anymore.</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
The thing about 3 keystrokes is really, reeeeeeeally important -
Emacs' shortcuts are usually bad at this.
</p>

<p>
Heard the joke in the last one about trying to type in your
name with these modifiers and seeing what Emacs would run?

</p>
</div>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
Most programs assume that no user will ever master all shortcuts.
Spacemacs not only provides a good set of mnemonic shortcuts, but it
also helps you internalize them, and discover new ones!
</p>

<p>
The 'prefix' notes are due to Emacs' internal implementation of
multiple shortcuts under the same key prefix, and are slowly being
updated with Spacemacs' implementation, that sets a useful label
there.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
This is help for Emacs' internal commands and shortcuts. Given that
everything in Emacs is implemented as an internal command, this means
that you can ask it about itself, and it will have a sensible answer.
This is RDoc/Haddock taken to the next level.

</p>
</div>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
This is a command for reading man pages inside Emacs. Given that
default implementations of man just pipe the contents into less/more,
this is much better because it allows one to do everything Emacs can
do to a buffer - especially the part about searching inside it, I find
invaluable.

<blockquote  class="fragment roll-in">
<p>
Layers help collect related packages together to provide features. For
example, the python layer provides auto-completion, syntax checking,
and repl support for python files. This approach helps keep
configuration organized and reduces overhead for the user by keeping
them from having to think about what packages to install
</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="fragment">
In other words: preconfigured goodies for your favorite language.
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
It does allow one some degree of flexibility, though. You can opt out
of any package any time, and replace it by your own preferences if you
know enough ELisp. So it's not something "set in stone" - just sane
defaults, really (so sane that I almost never change them).

Two backends for this: <a href="http://company-mode.github.io/">company</a> and <a href="http://auto-complete.org/">auto-complete</a>. Both are good on

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
That is, they don't feature context-aware autocompletion. Bummer.
</p>

<p>
It's mostly dynamic languages, that basically run a REPL and can
provide much better run-time information. Try that in Java or C# -
Emacs' Java integration still sucks, despite Eclim and other projects.
But, if you're an Emacs user, you're probably better served by
lighter-weight languages.

<p>
I'm biased towards company, but only because it's Spacemacs' default.

I'd mention something about SLIME, (Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for

Workflow here is great, I use it all the time. See a revision I want
to get back to? Flip around the file I want to investigate, just
review it, if necessary I'll copy the commit hash with 'Y' and
checkout with "SPC g uppercase c". It's so easy, it would make H.G.
Wells proud.

From the project website:
</p>

<blockquote  class="fragment roll-in">
<p>
Interactive Emacs functions that create URLs for files and commits in GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab/&#x2026; repositories.
</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="fragment">
<li>Spacemacs' integration makes git-link work seamlessly with git-timemachine</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
So you will actually link to the current revision's commit, instead of
linking directly to the branch. This behavior is only present in
Spacemacs, AFAIK.

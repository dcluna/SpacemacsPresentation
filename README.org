#+TITLE: Spacemacs: best Rails IDE you've ever seen
* Rails IDE?
Yeah, I agree. It's the best $LANGUAGE IDE, for sensible values of
$LANGUAGE (that is, not Java).

More seriously, this is a repository storing a (future?) presentation
introducing Spacemacs to my coworkers. Hope it's good enough to catch
their attention and convert a few people to the [[https://stallman.org/saintignucius.jpg][Church of Emacs]].
